<p className="lead">Hi there üëãüèª My name is Aibek</p>

I'm a full-stack engineer and creator of [ChkSnd](https://chksnd.app), a mobile app to create music
videos with an audio visualization. I also produce an electronic music
as [Brakata](https://hyperfollow.com/brakata) and publish them on streaming services.

As a programmer I'm very curious about `JavaScript`, `Golang`, `Java`, `iOS Devlopment`, `Swift`
, `DevOps` stuff.

I'm starting this blog to write about things happening around me - tech, coding, different ideas and
experimentations, etc. My hope is that the information posted here could be useful for someone else.
