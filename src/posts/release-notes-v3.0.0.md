Dear, Vibely Users!

I've upgraded the core of the video processing system, which means you can now enjoy even more stunning visual effects, add background videos, export in crispy 4K resolution, and much more! 🙌🏻

In this update, you'll find a single spectrum visualizer, along with simple image and text layers. But don't worry! I'll gradually bring back your favorite visualizers like circle spectrum, particles, and seek bar. So, please be patient and stay positive! 😄

Additionally, I've introduced premium features for those interested in exporting videos in 4K, removing watermarks, and accessing future premium visualizers. Don't worry tho, the existing visualizers will still be free to use!

Now, you might wonder why I've added premium subscription? There are two main reasons. Firstly, I've left my full-time job at Spotify to focus on Vibely, and I need financial support to sustain myself. Secondly, I'm thrilled to announce a partnership with SoundCloud. This collaboration requires financial backing, but I believe it's a fair arrangement. If you have any concerns, please let me know!

Overall, I'm incredibly excited to launch this new version of Vibely! I can't wait to see what you create and look forward to introducing even more exciting features soon!

Feel free to share your questions or feedback by [rating the app on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1528056717?mt=8&action=write-review) or sending me an email.

Cheers! 🥳
