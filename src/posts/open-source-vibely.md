I'm excited to announce that I've open-sourced some parts of [my iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1528056717) on GitHub. By making these components available, I hope to connect with fellow developers, learn from their experiences, and collectively enhance the quality of iOS development.

## VibelyUI

The first open-sourced package is [VibelyUI](https://github.com/heyaibek/vibely-ui-ios). This package contains the core UI elements that power Vibely, all built using Swift and SwiftUI. By extracting these components, I've made it easier for other developers to implement sleek, responsive interfaces in their own projects. VibelyUI includes a variety of customizable UI elements designed to be both visually appealing and highly functional.

## Spotify Picker for iOS

In addition to `VibelyUI`, I've also open-sourced [Spotify Picker for iOS](https://github.com/heyaibek/spotify-picker-ios). This package allows users to search and download preview tracks directly from Spotify’s API. The Spotify Picker is a great example of how Swift and SwiftUI can be used to integrate API services into iOS apps seamlessly. Whether you're building a music app or just need a way to incorporate Spotify tracks, this component can save you a lot of development time.

## Why Open Source?

One of the primary reasons for open-sourcing these components is to invite collaboration. By sharing my work, I hope to engage with other developers who can leverage Vibely’s code in their own projects. This is a fantastic opportunity to gather feedback, discover new use cases, and see how these components can be adapted and improved in different contexts.

Open-sourcing also serves as a learning platform for me. By exposing my code to feedback from the GitHub community, I can gain insights into writing more efficient, maintainable, and production-ready Swift code. Contributions from other developers, whether they involve new features or bug fixes, will undoubtedly enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of iOS development.

As a conclusion, I warmly invite developers to explore the [VibelyUI](https://github.com/heyaibek/vibely-ui-ios) and [SpotifyPicker](https://github.com/heyaibek/spotify-picker-ios) repositories. Whether you're interested in using these packages in your projects or contributing to their development, your participation is highly valued.
